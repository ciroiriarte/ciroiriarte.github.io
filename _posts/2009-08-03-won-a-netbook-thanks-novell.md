Well, I’ve been a SuSE user for quit some time, since 7.3 days and some months ago (around January) I was accepted as a SuSE Linux Enterprise 11 (SLES11) betatester. I was happy to test the bleeding edge enterprise distribution and happy to help releasing it.

In the mail list they stated that some Netbooks would be given away to some testers as a reward (i’m not sure how many units where available and can’t remember what the rules were…). I didn’t pay much attention as I NEVER win those kind of things, EVER.

Now, 5 months after SLES11 was released, I got an email from the people at SUSE stating I won one of them!!!!, I can’t wait to receive the package, it’s like Christmas!!!!! (with a gift I will actually like).
