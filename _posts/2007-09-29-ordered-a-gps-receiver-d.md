Well, i felt like i was in need of a new toy, so yesterday ordered an i-Blue 747 (gps receiver/track logger). So i guess i’ll be busy playing with it once it arrives. Already found two projects (http://gpsmapper.sourceforge.net/ and http://triptracker.sourceforge.net/) that would allow me to have a realtime track of my position using a GPRS enabled phone with the receiver. Also would like to contribute to OpenStreetMap, as there are no maps available for Paraguay, let’s see how hard can that be….
