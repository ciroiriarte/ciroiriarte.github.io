Already found two projects (http://gpsmapper.sourceforge.net/ and http://triptracker.sourceforge.net/) that would allow me to have a realtime track of my position using a GPRS enabled phone with the receiver. Also would like to contribute to OpenStreetMap, as there are no maps available for Paraguay, let’s see how hard can that be….
