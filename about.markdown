My name is Ciro Iriarte, I've been working with IT Infrastructure Technology (SAN, Centralized Storage, Virtualization, UNIX/Linux Operating System, Networking/SDN, Virtual Network Functions / VNF) in ISP/CSP environments for about 20 years. 

I'll be posting as time permits. Any feedback is welcomed!
