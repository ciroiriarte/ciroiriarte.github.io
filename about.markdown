My name is Ciro Iriarte, I've been working with IT Infrastructure Technology (SAN, Centralized Storage, Virtualization, Operating System, Networking/SDN, Virtual Network Functions / VNF) in the CSP/Telco landscape for about 20 years. 

I can't post as much as I would like to, but when I can, my notes end up here. Any feedback is welcomed!
